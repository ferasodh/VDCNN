1,@stacymadern thats the prob with Zyprexa its for ppl with Bi-Polar or Schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for 6 hrs
1,@stark3923 cipro has a known warning of weakening the Achilles tendon. ...
1,Screw you Paxil! You do wonders for anxiety but you make me a ultra lightweight
1,"Also, yay addiction. It's drugs i need for living, but it's still dependance. every time i get a ""paxil headache"" i realize this. oh well."
1,Wondered why my limbs ached and I was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. Forgot my venlafaxine. That'll be withdrawal then!
1,I am way too hyper to go home and do nothing tonight :( damn Prozac >.<
1,Rivaroxaban 2/2 lower back pain. Not very PC but am crippled by this drug. Taking more paracetamols. Must ring for 'phone consultation.
1,That nap was on point.... Cymbalta did that shit cuz I dont take naps...ever
1,I wish I could be tired. Shouldn't have taken the vyvanse. Now I'm never sleeping.
1,@Jakefletcha @Becki_65roses Cipro is real bad on your entire body! Take it from me (on disability since '09 thanks to just 12 pills).
1,I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
1,Question time #crohns #ibd #humira does anyone suffer from egg burps? What works for you
1,19.32 day 20 Rivaroxaban diary. Still residual aches and pains; only had 4 paracetamol today.
1,why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
1,"Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered"
1,"Just about dead, think it's bedtime.. Fuck you quetiapine"
1,"The day after Humira used to be a great one, full of energy, low pain. After a month, it is now a fatigue filled achy day. #rheum"
1,"Day has been a right off. Missed opticians&slept aw day. Sitting here torn faced, wi greasy hair&unwashed. Swollen feet thx to olanzapine."
1,"@JessBarrett227 Taking someone off 150mg off Seroquel, mixing it with Olanzapine in 2 wks causes psychosis - a proper assess was not done."
1,@BLEDNOS Lamictal and trileptal and seroquel...of course the seroquel I take in severe situations because gaining weight is never cool
1,"@HDAwareness cause UCD sayed I had Huntington's disease for like 8 yrs, then said high dose zyprexa caused a false diagnosis. I think I have"
1,@Joanne__Howe enbrel is a miracle but it made my eyes worse :( so couldn't have it anymore :(
1,@brain_opera I had to taper myself down. I think the Seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. I've had it ever since.
1,"Actually it was more like a prison but with nurses instead of guards, olanzapine pill n IM= #zombies"
1,@drdrew I recently stopped taking effexor 225 what can i do to ease my withdrawls?I feel miserable right now and very angry.Please any ideas
1,What to do? Not looking forward to cold turkey withdrawals from Pristiq... sense of impending doom. Anxiety only makes the situation worse.
1,"Rivaroxaban diary ctd , neck and should ache, lower back pain and knee ache."
1,@david82wilkins @CFAware Neither of you appear to be aware that Cipro can cripple otherwise healthy people...doctor fail to mention that?
1,Pt of mine died from Cipro RT @CIPROisPOISON: @gastromom If only more doctors thought like you! I lost my entire life to 12 Cipro pills
1,I'm loosing so much blood right now. Humira is some scurry ish.
1,Getting a seven page text of garbled ramblings from someone detailing that their titrating of venlafaxine led to a break up is unusual.
1,Anyone who will listen: never ever take Effexor/Venlafaxine. Paraesthesia abound.
1,Just wondering where the side effect of hating the world is stated on vyvanse advertisements?
1,venlafaxine makes me feel so nauseas hahahaha oh god I'm going to chunder in my geography lesson help
1,"Toothache. Discovered that somewhere in the paracetamol, codeine, sertraline #quetiapine combination there is a bad mix. #hallucinating"
1,@PosAware my t cell went up w ith humira I also have crohns disease. I wish u guys had more articles with people like me in it
1,"Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol"
1,"@SpicyNyx fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround #bipolar"
1,"Hmm, interesting. I may have been undergoing Baclofen withdrawal hence the anxiety for the past few months… #hypochondria"
1,"@illtreaturite1 Fluox a friend 4 years, but switch to cymbalta 4 anti-depress/pain control. I OCD worry. Can't stop running mind"
1,"@fragileannie @meilufay I tried Baclofen, another common muscle relaxer, and had too many side-effects from it, including worsening pain."
1,@skernandez because I realized Vyvanse after a certain time of taking it increased my anxiety and made me more irrational.
1,@neomoms I had been blaming my dizziness upon standing to my menopause but now on HRT & no more flashes so looked at cymbalta side effs
1,So I may be allergic to the metoprolol. Rash on my face. Needing my inhaler daily since Friday.
1,@Glass1ncision -nods- My zombie-ness when I first wake up in the morning is mostly from my nightly meds too (Seroquel).
1,Do not ever get on Cymbalta. Getting off of it is HELL!
1,I suggest never stop taking Effexor abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
1,I resent taking olanzapine as it is the side effects of olanzapine that were mistaken for negative symptoms of schizophrenia
1,@nicoleccoelho I take fluoxetine and it doesn't do shit it just makes me dizzy and tired
1,My vyvanse is seriously about to drive me crazy
1,Almost vomited on a zinc lozenge #yuk
1,"can't sleep, but i'm afraid that the muscle tremors keep me awake even worse if i take promethazine in combination with fluoxetine..."
1,People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
1,@weswroten @bullfrogr wow Paxil sent me into a huge hypo manic mixed episode.
1,Lamotrigine causing steven johnson syndrome
1,This Vyvanse got me sweating right now and I dont even know why
1,"@Shellyfanelly I was on #azathioprine for about 8 years, it worked well, now on #Humira instead though which is knocking me about"
1,"@sapphire20 to it, and now I'm on Humira with just the bloat to battle. Things sometimes get super shitty in every sense. But stay strong xx"
1,@brokenmind_ Quetiapine was horrific for me in relation to wait gain. Such a horror story. But the weight will come off one day at a time.
1,No one likes me on my Vyvanse #TooChill #Zombiemode
1,"@neurobonkers also, ""meth mouth"" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for ADHD. nor in Prozac, which similarly dries mouth"
1,"...but then Staph is all like 'I'll just mutate my gyrase gene,' and suddenly everyone's *shocked* it's Levaquin resistant! Psh. #OHonID"
1,This night of no sleep is brought to you by Vyvanse.
1,Woke up to breakfast in bed...well couch because I'm addicted to the new 3D wifi tv. Too bad I have no appetite. Thanks Cymbalta.
1,@JameeTMiller I didn't have side effects when I started taking Cymbalta. After about 6 mths had to stop because it raised my blood pressure.
1,Little did I know that I would go through withdrawals when coming off of Effexor XR. #antidepressants
1,I can't secretly try and come off my olanzapine as my CPN and psychiatrist will notice the weight loss!
1,"@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx"
1,I've been on Paxil for 10 years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but I guess I've built up tolerance and I come too fast.
1,@teepeewest Did you get floxed too? I've been in bed since 2009 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills! They never told me this can be permanent!!!
1,@joshuagates You forgot the immodium for when the Cipro kills all the good bacteria. :) #travelskills
1,Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
1,"@Justjeffpls Seroquel can cause high blood sugars, talk to your Dr. exercise everyday. Lose weight. If U have type 1, ask someone else"
1,SO IT FUCKING TURNS OUT THAT A SIDE EFFECT OF EFFEXOR IS A LOSS OF APPETITE
1,@anwen @Ellwynnnnn Venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
1,@gastromom WOW...if only more doctors thought like you!! I lost my entire life to twelve Cipro pills.
1,"Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Last tablet taken Tuesday 18th, 4 days ago. Woken up in pain. Bad fluid retention (uneven) on both legs."

1,@McMorag my dreams became vivider I think with Effexor #BPDChat
1,"The Seroquel the doc gave me, makes doing things difficult. . . But if I don't do something, I'll fall asleep. The catch-22 of crazy."
1,So I ran out of Victoza before payday & restarted it yesterday. Bleh: nausea. It did help me lose @ 10 lbs. but I found 3 when I ran out.
1,Trazodone is no joke. Slept through every alarm.
1,"All nighter is killing me right now, I hate you vyvanse"
1,Wide awake and this trazodone starting to feel like a sugar pill.. I'd actually prefer to be at work right bout now.
1,"@KarimS3D Olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much"
1,"Anyway, I was just feeling itchy and my neck was red so they gave me benedryl with my #tysabri. Might be a coincidence but just in case"
1,Weird thing about paxil: feeling fully awake and energized and feeling completely tired and half-asleep at the same time.
1,That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
1,@ajswurld I'm allergic to Enbrel :-( bad reaction
1,"@PArthritis I don't know that one, but metho made me sick everyday I took it. I had to stop. Enbrel has worked wonders for me .. so far"

1,Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating
1,Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.

1,@Zombie_girl_2 I tried that going cold turkey on venlafaxine and depakote is not a good idea I dreamt colours and lost my fucking mind aghh!
1,@whiskey_girl33 oh yuck. We all have our least favorite body fluid. Mine is aerosolized blood. Nosebleed on Xarelto -eeeew
1,@RayyDePotter yeaa bihh all jacked up on vyvanse!
1,“@vyvanseswag: I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.” OMG SO TRUE!! Ahh!
1,I haven't slept in 2 days due to #vyvanse
1,"@CIPROisPOISON ironically, the pulmonologist I work with told me about his own devastating bout with 'tendonitis' after Cipro"
1,@cloudtoad @MrsYisWhy @bigthink each brain is different. The SSRI I'm on has worked really well. Prozac made me a zombie. #Brains
1,Losing it. Could not remember the word power strip. Wonder which drug is doing this memory lapse thing. My guess the Cymbalta. #helps
1,Mann I've been having the munchies ALL day eatin weird shxt ahaha my zyprexa gotta nigga tearin up food
1,@RachaelHerron @marrije I haaaated Trazodone. Don't be afraid to ask doc for something else if side effects continue. Gave me migraines.
1,"@trainingwithra Nope, was on #Enbrel 5yrs & had to get off due to unrelenting flare. Been on #Humira since Dec 2012. #rheum"
1,"do you have any medication allergies? ""ASTHMA!!!"" Me: ""........"" Pt: ""no wait. avelox, that's it!"" ""So no other allergies?"" ""RIGHT!"" *cont"
1,@ctr1945 my mom used Rivaroxaban and it gave her a terrible time with weakness and muscle pain.
1,@LilythePurr I've had too much quetiapine today - I'm zombified.
1,@Kirkby007 #hcsm I start #Chemo on Tues b/c of #humira so I know. It helped but it then destroyed my lungs.
1,Why do I always get the seroquel munchies!?
1,Exhausted...can't fall asleep. Don't wanna take a trazadone and wake up hungover. #Sleepdisorderproblems
1,Don't need any alcohol really when fluoxetine just makes me feel like I can't even stand
1,@thebeecharmer97 @deadfanclub I would NOT recommend toying around with Cipro if you don't have to. Did you know it can cripple you for life?
1,"@stevecoy @JoelAnair all the things I have just make me sleepy as hell: Cymbalta, Klonopin, Ambien. wait what if I take em all togethhssaagg"
1,"@opium_district I've been having them today too, three days without effexor. I completely understand what you mean. every hit, lightheaded.."
1,I don't know if vyvanse was a good idea #nosleep
1,"I need more energy today. Don't know where to get it from, though. This is the result of going off #Tysabri for #MSandLife and heat-related."
1,How anyone can say there is no withdrawal from prozac withdrawal is beyond me. Their answer is to go back on it and up the dose.
1,"@abianne the Effexor may have been pushing me toward hypomania, so we are trying just an ssri, then see if a mood stabilizer is needed."
1,"@AnyssiaKaissa Depakote made me feel flat, but helps many. Zyprexa can cause weight gain, so be very careful. I can't tolerate it."
1,@SamAmbreen venlafaxine definitely does mine. Also makes me need 15 hours sleep a day. Hence now unmediated & rollercoastery.
1,"I finally had an appetite, made food, gone. HUMIRA WHY WON'T YOU LET ME EAT"
1,really bad RLS fron seroquel :(
1,@ayegraybay I knowwishful thinking. My Humira shot doesn't even work for me anymore and when it does I get so sick.

1,"Promise, brownies honor I'm not stupid, i have been forgetting everything lately #paxil"
1,Wish it was Monday...seeing doctor tomorrow & want to see if he has any suggestions for my withdrawal. #paroxetine #anxiety #fedup
1,"@NireBryce Thanks. There is a nonzero chance that the discomfort I am feeling was caused by going back on Cymbalta, possibly too quickly."
1,I think I'm gong to speak my GP about reducing Quetiapine dosage. The weight gain from it is scaring the hell out of me.
1,"@Kirkby007 If u r on #humira and have respiratory probs - see ur doc. That;s how it all started of me. Be well. Nice chatting,"
1,"@Sectioned_ Anybody know anything about side effects of venlafaxine? Come off 'em 6wks ago, still feeling awful. physical withdrawal awful"
1,Does cipro make anyone's else's brain turn to mush or am I actually just going crazy?
1,@TheEastMovie Thank you so much for getting the message out...wish I could see the film but Bayer CRIPPLED ME with Cipro back in 2009!
1,"@ABittersweet1 Cipro destroyed my entire body, from head to toe. Bedridden since 2009. Be VERY careful."
1,Nicotine is literally poison. But sometimes you gotta find out the hard way. #headache
1,Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
1,@dsymons @trainingwithra I agree that the after sting is much worse from #humira than #enbrel #rheum
1,All I have done today is sleep. And I still need to sleep more. This is a welcome change. #quetiapine
1,Only change so far since switching from Lexapro to Cymbalta: now I might notice if I got hit in the crotch w/ a lance in a jousting accident
1,"Cymbalta, my mood has worsened"
1,"@almostwell My blood pressure is fine, but my heart started lurching two weeks ago. Savella didn't work for me, yeah. Cymbalta rules!"
1,@Lanternlizard cymbalta switch is part of what made me flip. But any snri with family hx of mania puts you at risk.
1,"I can feel my heart starting to palpitate from vyvanse, red bull, and nicotine. That's probably par for the course for finals week, right?"
1,I'm sorry you have ostrich halitosis @DanielleJMoody but that IS a side effect of once monthly boniva.
1,@sam_dietrich just had the Viibryd vision shake thing again very cool

1,It turns out that I can still ride a bike in spite of my ataxia (side effect of Lamotrigine) It has been at least 25 years.
1,Well! That was icky. I think Lamictal and Lexapro do not get along when taken within 3 hours of each other.
1,venlafaxine withdrawal is horrific
1,"How is it that Vyvanse gives me dry mouth, but I still produce this much saliva in my sleep?"
1,"I'm too numb to feel, blow out the candle, blindness #np #cymbalta"

1,Pretty sure the quetiapine was affecting my sense of taste
1,Ooooop. Anyone know if amoxicillin and pregabalin have an interaction? Never had one with fluoxetine and losartan... So dizzy!
1,I've had OCD symptoms like that for a while but seems like the Seroquel exacerbates things and now this. :\
1,Shouldn't have taken 80mg of vyvanse today... #cantsleep
1,"20.05 day 16 Rivaroxaban diary. Intense back and knee pain most of day; taken more paracetamol. Had to shop, walking painful."

1,"@CIPROisPOISON I'm in so much pain now... tendonitis, headaches, cognitive issues... I feel violated. #Cipro"

1,Half of seroquel knocks me out so fast and im asleep for at least 10 hours...
1,Today was hard - arguing with a professional. Was told seroquel doesn’t make you put on weight - I and my extra 20kg beg to differ.

1,I'm so allergic to trazodone but I haven't been taking it so no one believes me :::---))))
1,On a related note: Tysabri causes weight gain. As does body pain/inability to exercise. Sigh. #fuckms
