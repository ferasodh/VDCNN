pos,"Also, yay addiction. It's drugs i need for living, but it's still dependance. every time i get a ""paxil headache"" i realize this. oh well."
pos,Wondered why my limbs ached and I was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. Forgot my venlafaxine. That'll be withdrawal then!

pos,I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
pos,Question time #crohns #ibd #humira does anyone suffer from egg burps? What works for you
pos,19.32 day 20 Rivaroxaban diary. Still residual aches and pains; only had 4 paracetamol today.
pos,why do I not remember going to bed or waking up (the answer: probably seroquel)
pos,"Only one day in and Mirtazapine is like fluoxetine all over again, it just makes me so tiered"
pos,"Just about dead, think it's bedtime.. Fuck you quetiapine"

pos,@drdrew I recently stopped taking effexor 225 what can i do to ease my withdrawls?I feel miserable right now and very angry.Please any ideas

pos,"@fragileannie @meilufay I tried Baclofen, another common muscle relaxer, and had too many side-effects from it, including worsening pain."
pos,@skernandez because I realized Vyvanse after a certain time of taking it increased my anxiety and made me more irrational.

pos,"@sapphire20 to it, and now I'm on Humira with just the bloat to battle. Things sometimes get super shitty in every sense. But stay strong xx"
pos,@brokenmind_ Quetiapine was horrific for me in relation to wait gain. Such a horror story. But the weight will come off one day at a time.
pos,No one likes me on my Vyvanse #TooChill #Zombiemode
pos,"@neurobonkers also, ""meth mouth"" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for ADHD. nor in Prozac, which similarly dries mouth"

pos,Woke up to breakfast in bed...well couch because I'm addicted to the new 3D wifi tv. Too bad I have no appetite. Thanks Cymbalta.
pos,@JameeTMiller I didn't have side effects when I started taking Cymbalta. After about 6 mths had to stop because it raised my blood pressure.
pos,Little did I know that I would go through withdrawals when coming off of Effexor XR. #antidepressants
pos,I can't secretly try and come off my olanzapine as my CPN and psychiatrist will notice the weight loss!
pos,"@Glinda_R @SpooniesCouch Cymbalta withdrawal is getting top billing at the moment, however. Ugh! xx"
pos,I've been on Paxil for 10 years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but I guess I've built up tolerance and I come too fast.
pos,@teepeewest Did you get floxed too? I've been in bed since 2009 thanks to just 12 Cipro pills! They never told me this can be permanent!!!
pos,@joshuagates You forgot the immodium for when the Cipro kills all the good bacteria. :) #travelskills
pos,Owww. I hurt my foot. & am concerned. 1st warning on Cipro is tendon damage. :-/ It certainly wasn't a rupture. I'm sure I'm just paranoid.
pos,"@Justjeffpls Seroquel can cause high blood sugars, talk to your Dr. exercise everyday. Lose weight. If U have type 1, ask someone else"

pos,That Seroquel has been given me some seriously fucked up dreams.
